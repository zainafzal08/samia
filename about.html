      <h1> About me </h1>
      <p>Hello! I’m Samia.</p>
      <p>I didn’t always know I wanted to be a Designer. My love for designing well thought-out product experiences came from learning all about customer experience and service design whilst working at the Apple store.‍</p>
      <p>Along with my love for design and great experiences, human behaviour also always interested me, I wanted to understand people at a deeper level and why they behave the way they do, and in the hopes of helping people I majored in Psychology. I very quickly learned I was too empathetic to become a Clinical Psychologist and couldn’t desensitise myself from the problems people faced.</p>
      <p>I find the full customer experience fascinating, being in awe of beautiful user experiences in different products led me to research and dig deeper in understanding why I found all this so fulfilling.</p>
      <p>Finally, I found my calling of Product Design where I am able to bring my love for beautiful experiences, good design and human behaviour together.</p>
      <p>he journey so far has been great and I can’t wait for what comes next. When not designing, I am an illustrator, the occasional artist, lover of good coffee, taking photos of the places I travel to and usually make my friends fat with my love for cooking different cuisines. Oh and I love a good cardio workout mainly to burn off the cooking.‍</p>
      <p>Let’s chat about design, illustration, food or travel, drop me an <a href="mailto:samiajkhan@icloud.com">email</a> and say hi!</p>
